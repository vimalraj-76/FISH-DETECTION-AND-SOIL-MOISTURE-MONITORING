# FISH-DETECTION-AND-SOIL-MOISTURE-MONITORING
This solution is about an amphistar model which can be applied both in land and water. This multi sensor device can efficiently move on lands with the help of propellers which uses Fiber Bragg grating optic sensor to detect the amount of moisture in the cultivated lands and can send a notification message when the moisture content hits below the specified cut-in value. The direction and speed of propellers is controlled by a microcontroller attached in the amphistar which will work under the control commands given by the user. This device can swim in the layers of water using the same propellers which can be applied to detect the amount of fishes in a particular area by sending the amphistar unmanned, before fishermans getting into water. The fish detection is done using Sonar Technology which gives us the image indicating the presence of fish in a small cliff typed symbol, this images are further sent to the the user at the seashore with the help of long range communication modules and can we viewed through web app integrated with Thingspeak cloud platform.
